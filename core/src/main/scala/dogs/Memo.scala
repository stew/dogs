/** A memo is a recipe for creating a memoized version of a function.
  *
  * The contract is that you pass in a function and get back a new version of that function that
  * uses the specified mechanism to cache results. A `Memo` doesn't necessarily guarantee that a
  * function will be called only once for a given input: each memo will have its own behavior with
  * respect to this.
  *
  * This provides a separation of the way a function is memoized from the point
  * where it happens. This both reduces boilerplate calls to functions like
  * [[scala.collection.mutable.Map.getOrElseUpdate `getOrElseUpdate`]] and allows for the
  * possibility of switching out implementations dynamically or with a single change.
  *
  * @example
  * {{{
  * import dogs.Memo
  *
  * // Memoize a function directly
  * val fastValue = Memo.mutableHashMapMemo { s: String => ??? }
  *
  * // Abstract over memoization strategy
  * val memoize = Memo.concurrentTrieMapMemo
  * val getValue = memoize { a: Int => ??? }
  *
  * // Memoize an existing function
  * def myFunction(s: String): Int = ???
  * val myFastFunction = memoize(myFunction)
  * }}}
  *
  * @tparam A the upper bound of the domain values that this `Memo` can store
  * @tparam B the upper bound of the range values that this `Memo` can store
  *
  * @note Implementors should ensure that a `Memo` produces a new backing store each time
  * [[Memo.apply apply]] is called so that it cannot produce incorrect results if two functions
  * disagree about the output for a given input. The `Memo` is the recipe, not the data store.
