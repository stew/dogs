It intends to be a library containing data structures which facilitate pure functional programming in the Scala programming language. Some of these are replacements for structures already present in the Scala standard library, but with improvements in safety, some are data structures for which there is no analogue in the Scala standard library.

### Getting Started

Cats Collections is currently available for Scala 2.11 and 2.12.

To get started with sbt, simply add the following to your `build.sbt` file:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.typelevel" %% "cats-collections-core" % "0.7.0"
```

The `0.7.0` release is feature-wise virtually identical to the previous release (`0.6.10`), with all references of "dogs" replaced by "cats-collections".

### CONTRIBUTING

Contributions in all forms (including discussion, suggestions, bug reports, usage reports, pull requests, patches, etc) are welcome and encouraged from everyone!
