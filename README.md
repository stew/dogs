It intends to be a library containing data structures which facilitate
pure functional programming in the Scala programming language. Some of
these are replacements for structures already present in the Scala
standard library, but with improvements in safety, some are data
structures for which there is no analogue in the Scala standard
library.

### Getting Started

Dogs is currently available for Scala 2.11.

To get started with SBT, simply add the following to your `build.sbt`
file:

```scala

```
