# Range

`Range` represents a range [x, y] that can be generated by using discrete operations [Enum](enum).

## Supported Operations

- `start`: starting value of `Range`.
- `end`: ending value of `Range`.
- `toList`: returns all the values in the `Range` as a `List`.
- `contains(value)`: verifies `value` is within the `Range`.
- `contains(range)`: verifies `range` is within the `Range`.
- `generate`: returns all the values in the `Range [start, end]`
- `reverse`: returns all the values in the `Range [end, start]`
- `-(other)`: Calculate the difference with `Range`.
	- It returns a tuple with the difference to the right and to the left of `Range`.
	- It basically calculates what is to the *left* of `other` that is in `Range` and what is to the *right* of `other` that is in `Range` (in both cases it does not include elements in `other`)
