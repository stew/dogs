# ISet

ISet is an
[Intensional Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensional_definition). as
opposed to [Set](set) which is an
[Extensional Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensional_definition). This
is to say that membership in an ISet is defined by a predicate
function which returns true for any value which is a member of the
set, and false for any value which is not a member of the set.
